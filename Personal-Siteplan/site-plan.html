        Character Builder
        On the first page I think there would be an explanation that breaks down each of the parts of creating a character and where you might want to find them. 
        Whether that would references to a website or sections of the book itself. 
        This section would also have ideas and examples that you can reference in case you cant think of any ideas
        
        <br>Website Content:

        <br>This Website is designed to help you on your journey of making a fun and awesome dnd character

          <br>Step 5: Fill in Details
          <br>[explination]
        <br><br><br>Example Character
        <br>During the first page there will also be a fully fleshed out character sheet so they 
        can see the end example and then break down what each part means and where to find 
        it as a part of the general tutorial

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="Images/Dnd_Logo.png" alt="image for homepage" width="600" height="600">
        <img src="Images/Sheet.png" alt="image for homepage" width="500" height="600">

      
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Creator
        <br>On the second page I plan to have a character creator that takes in all the important info and then saves it as a json or another file type to be loaded later. That way the user can take all the info they learned on the first page and apply it

        <br>Notes
        <br>In the character creator there will also be notes at each section explaining what each stat could be used for so that when someone is picking certain things they can make a more informed decision

        <br>an example would be next to the Ability Scores:
        
        <br>T<br><br>he best way to think of it is to think in terms of a tomato    
        <br>Strength is being able to crush a tomato. 
        <br>Dexterity is being able to dodge a tomato. 
        <br>Constitution is being able to eat a bad tomato. 
        <br>Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit. 
        <br>Wisdom is knowing not to put a tomato in a fruit salad. 
        <br>Charisma is being able to sell a tomato based fruit salad

        <br>Heres an example of what the main website will look like from a project I was already working on

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Display
        <br>On the final page will be a display of the character sheet they made so it looks all nice and organized. That way they can see how it might look on a normal character sheet instead of just fill in text boxes all in a row.
        <br> Here is another image of what a basic version of what the display could look like
